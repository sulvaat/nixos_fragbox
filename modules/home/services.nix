         card very tall and crowds out notifications — and since the whole
         control center is ONE scroll area capped at the monitor height, a tall
         card means only ~1 notification is visible. These user-priority
         overrides compact the card (smaller art, tighter padding/margins,
         smaller text) so ~3 notifications fit alongside it, while keeping the
         card in place and the accent-blue control hover. Tune -gtk-icon-size /
